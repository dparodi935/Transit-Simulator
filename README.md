# Transit-Simulator
Program that allows you to create a planetary system and visualise the effect on the starlight. Code is based off Chapter 8 from the book "Real-World Python" by Lee Vaughan, with my main addition being the system customisation. 

Features:
- Set the orbits and sizes of planets and their moons
- Visualise the transits with OpenCV with an accompanying light curve

To do list:
- Add ability to change inclination of orbits
- Let user create other shapes such as rectangles to represent non-planetary objects like megastructures
- Add atmospheres
- Add sunspots
